<p> Web Gardening is a web application that serves as a digital assistance in the growth of spring flowers. It offers users a variety of resources and knowledge to help them properly care for plants, as well as an interactive experience to help them develop their gardening skills.</p>
 <p>    The application allows users to manage their own crops as well as purchase flowers. The program will receive data of interest from a range of sensors, such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, and a stream of photos of the monitored plants' progress. The program should recommend irrigation activities, temperature and/or brightness adjustments, and harvesting based on the sensor values and the growth period of the farmed plant.

<h3><span id="Title"></span><span class="title_cap" id="Title">3.2 Title </span></h3>
<div class="text">
    <p> The term "Plant Palooza" was chosen to connote a lively and exciting atmosphere surrounding the world of gardening, particularly the growing of spring flowers. "Palooza" is an American slang phrase for a large event that is full of energy and fun, and is frequently linked with music and entertainment. As a result, "Plant Palooza" connotes a flower and gardening party where the community can come to learn, share knowledge, and enjoy the experience of growing plants and flowers.

    <p> Currently, the shopping cart feature is designed to be simple and user-friendly, with a neat menu that opens up when the cursor is moved over it. The menu displays the products that have been added to the cart. However, to further enhance the user's experience, it could be beneficial to create a dedicated Shopping Cart page. This page would provide additional details such as the quantity of products in the cart, along with a more detailed overview of each product.</p>
