<p> Web Gardening is a web application that serves as a digital assistance in the growth of spring flowers. It offers users a variety of resources and knowledge to help them properly care for plants, as well as an interactive experience to help them develop their gardening skills.</p>
 <p>    The application allows users to manage their own crops as well as purchase flowers. The program will receive data of interest from a range of sensors, such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, and a stream of photos of the monitored plants' progress. The program should recommend irrigation activities, temperature and/or brightness adjustments, and harvesting based on the sensor values and the growth period of the farmed plant.

<div class="text">
    <p> The term "Plant Palooza" was chosen to connote a lively and exciting atmosphere surrounding the world of gardening, particularly the growing of spring flowers. "Palooza" is an American slang phrase for a large event that is full of energy and fun, and is frequently linked with music and entertainment. As a result, "Plant Palooza" connotes a flower and gardening party where the community can come to learn, share knowledge, and enjoy the experience of growing plants and flowers.
